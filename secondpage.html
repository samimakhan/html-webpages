<p> <b> Paper Towns </b> is a fantastic, interesting and unique novel that I thoroughly enjoyed.
I was very eager to read this following <br>
how much I loved <i> An Abundance of Katherines </i>, and I decided that I had to read it <br>
before I saw the film due to my golden rule: <u> read the book before you watch the film.</u> And this book did not disappoint… </p>

<p> Our protagonist is <ins> Quentin 'Q' Jacobsen </ins>, whose boring life is turned upside down when <br>
the stunning Margo Roth Spiegelman moves in next door. To the young Q, Margo is an adventure. <br>
It's all fun and games <del> until one day Margo and Q come across a dead body. </del>
Years later, our two main <br> characters are in high school and have drifted apart. They hardly speak
until Margo climbs into <br> Q's bedroom and invites him to join her on a mission of revenge. They have <br>
their night of adventure, but when Q wakes up in the morning, Margo has vanished. The main plot follows <br>
 Q and his friends as they try to uncover the cryptic clues Margo left behind… </p>

<p> This is a very cleverly written plot. The trail of clues gives the book a driving force, something that <br>
 makes you want to read on. It balances the comedy and the diary-like stories with the mystery brilliantly, <br>
by mixing them together. The two are inseparable. </p>
<p> My favourite element of the plot is the three sections. The book is split into three parts, namely The Strings, <br>
 The Grass and The Vessel. These represent the three metaphors used throughout the book. Each section focuses on one <br>
of the metaphors, and it is mentioned in a number of forms. It also sets the atmosphere for each section: The Strings <br>
is about breaking, and irreversible change; The Grass is about friends, family and memories; The Vessel is about <br>
journeys and final destinations. This was a very clever move that I haven't seen in a YA novel before.
