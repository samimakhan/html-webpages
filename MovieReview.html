      <p> When I chose to watch Paper Towns as just another teenage romance film, 
          <b> <i> I could not have been more wrong.</i> </b> Paper Towns (<i> based on a book of the same name by John Green </i>)
          is not your typical boy-meets-girl love story; it provides food dor thought instead of making 
          you reach for a box of tissues. Quentin Jacobsen (<i> Natt Wolff </i>) aspires to live an ordinary life—acquire
          a degree and a job, tie the knot and have kids by the age of thirty. This is essentially society’s 
          definition of the ‘successful’ life, and he believes he’ll be happy once he’s ticked off all these 
          items in his head. But one day he’s whisked off in the middle of the night to have the adventure of
          a lifetime by Margo Roth Spiegelman (<i> Cara Delevingne </i>), a close childhood friend of his. <br>
         Adventurous and quirky, Margo challenges this belief: “Isn’t there anything that can make you happy right now?” <br>
         This question really made me think. We try so hard to craft the perfect life for ourselves, we forget 
         to be happy along the way. We think we’ll be content with ourselves and our lives once we’ve got that
         high-class education, that perfect job. But happiness essentially comes from within; we forget that 
         sometimes. Quentin later feels that he experienced the best few days of his life when he followed Margo
         and her revenge plot through to the end, and when he set out on his first ever road trip in pursuit of her. <br>
        The plot does have a bit of excitement, but at other times the film feels rather slow. There’s also some 
        nostalgia as Quentin and his friends look back on their final year of high school and recount all that 
        they would never get to do anymore. This connects on a personal level because I’ve been through the same
        situation this very year. <br>
