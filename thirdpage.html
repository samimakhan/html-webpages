<p> <b> Paper Towns starts with nine-year-olds Quentin “Q” Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman <br>
discover the corpse of Robert Joyner, a soon to be divorced man who committed suicide in the <br>
Jefferson Park.</b> </p>
<p> Nine years later, Quentin and Margo grew apart from each other considering that they are <br>
neighbors. One night, Margo shows up in Quentin’s window with black paint on her face. She asks <br>
Quentin to help her that night with eleven missions to get revenge on the people that have hurt her <br>
throughout her high school years. She especially needs Quentin's car and assistance driving. Margo <br>
convinces Quentin to take his mother’s minivan, sneak out of his home on a school night, and help her <br>
seek revenge. </p>
<p> Margo takes Quentin to an adventure filled with fish, vandalizing, spray-paint, breaking into SeaWorld, <br>
 and waxing a bully’s eyebrow while sleeping. After her eleven things are completed, Quentin is glad that he <br>
is back to being friends with Margo. The next day, Margo never shows up to school or the next three days.<br>
 Because Margo had already run away from home, her parents are worry-free since they expect her to come back. <br>
Quentin was the last person her parents saw her with when her father found her in Quentin house at night. <br>
A private investigator asks some question about where Margo could have run away. He notices a poster of <br>
Woody Guthrie taped to her bedroom shades. When her parents left home, Quentin bribes Margo’s sister, <br>
so they can investigate her room. The poster leads them to a song called “Walt Whitman’s Niece." The song <br>
leads them to a poem called “Song of Myself,” by Walt Whitman. In Margo’s room, there is a copy of the poem <br>
with highlighted text. One day, Quentin unhinges his door and finds another clue: an address. The next day, <br>
Quentin and his friends skip school and drive to the address left by Margo. When they arrive, they find an <br>
abandoned mall. Inside Margo left a message painted in the walls that says, “You will go to the paper towns <br>
and you will never come back.” Quentin believes that this is Margo’s way of confirming her suicide while his <br>
friends believe it means she was tired of her fake life. </p>
<p> Quentin spends a stretch of time looking for more clues with no success. On the day of his graduation, he <br>
looks at the map of New York he found in the abandoned mall. The map has pinholes - one of them in a place called <br>
 Agloe, New York. He looks up Agloe on the Internet and finds that Agloe is a copyright trap, and that its population <br>
rose up from zero to one - until of May twenty-ninth. Quentin, Ben, Lacey, and Radar skip their graduation to drive to <br>
New York to find Margo. Since he knows Margo changed the population on the site, they have to arrive at Agloe in less <br>
than one day. </p>
<p> When the gang arrives in Agloe, New York, they find Margo living in a barn. Margo is shocked to see them since <br>
the clues she left weren’t intended to find her. Angry at her reaction, Radar, Lacey, and Ben leave the barn and check <br>
into a motel. Quentin learns that his vision of Margo was fake - similar to the one she had been projecting to everyone <br>
else she met. Later, Quentin tells Margo that he was mad because she made him waste his time. Margo tells him that he really <br>
saved her because he wanted to feel like the superhero saving the girl. He later accepts that it was obvious that he didn’t <br>
expect Margo to live the image he had of her. They both say that they love each other and they kiss. Later, Margo tells him to <br>
come with her to New York but Quentin tells her that he has a life back in Orlando. Margo and Quentin say their last goodbyes <br>
and promise each other to keep in contact. </p>
